## ðŸš€ Pre-Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

1. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Hosting Platform**
   - Upload `dist/` folder contents
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up custom domain (optional)

3. **Configure Appwrite**
   - Create project and database
   - Set up collections (automatically created on first use)
   - Configure authentication settings

4. **Test Production**
   - Verify all features work with production APIs
   - Test user registration and login
   - Confirm recipe search and filtering
   - Validate database operations

## âœ¨ Post-Deployment

- Monitor API usage and rate limits
- Track user engagement and recipe preferences
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Set up backup strategies for user data
